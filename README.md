# Finger-Tack-Volume-Controller
Artificial Intelligence Finger tracking system volume controller.
# Intro
Using the computer vision methods with the vision from the webcam of machine hand of the client/user get tracked and recognized with multiple hand plotting points cable of understanding certain visual movements/actions of the client/user's hand and fingers, resulting in controlling the volume of the system without touching the machine just by some defined movements of fingers and hand.
# Get started [user]
1. Adjust the hand in front of the webcam of the machine. Soon the points will get plotted on the hand indicating the program is operationally started.
2. Stretch all your fingers of a hand and at a certain point, the user will notice a noticeable point on the index and thumb finger joined with a line.
3. Now the level of volume depends on the distance of these two fingers a.e when the distance between index and thumb increases the level of volume increases and vice versa, but as this process may return up encountering bugs while releasing the hand out of the box.
4. So now just by adjusting the distance between two fingers the level of volume can be set and once it is done the user can now move down the pinky finger to fix and synchronize the volume level indicated with the system volume.
5. User can also keep the pinky finger constantly down and adjust the fingers to sync real-time system volume with the distance of two-finger.
# Get started [Developer]
Contains:Files:
1. init_hand_tracking_module.py
2. main_volume_hand_controll_bug_fixed_optimised.py
3. test.py (just for modules reference)

init_hand_tracking_module.py : This file consists of the primary essential modules along with certain libraries included with initial functions and methods which will be calling in the main file of the program.

main_volume_hand_controll_bug_fixed_optimised.py : This file contains the main running functions callings and user interference for integrating usage of the program.

test.py : This file is just for the reference and idea of the modules, packages, and libraries commands that will be needed and executed with the implementation of the program.
# Testemonials
*-Adjusting the hand properly.

*-Setting up (syncronising system volume with the distance of fingers) final volume.

# Real time uses and scope
This project can be used and implemented very easily and low specification machine with a webcam.
Also even without touching and interrupting the flow of play user/client can change and control the volume level.

Scope: Can be implemented in various teaching fields and industries where for many technical and non-technical purposes. Further many additional features can be added to this project in order to increase its usability and utility.
